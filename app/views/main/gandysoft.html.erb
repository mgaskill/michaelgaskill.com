  <em>GandySoft PAIRS</em> is a full-function Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) product
  providing revolutionary Real Estate Appraisal analytics.  The game-changing
  solution that PAIRS brings to the appraisal market is the combination of using
  <em>full market data</em>, a range of traditional estimation methods, a
  proprietary <em>iterative matched pairs</em> method, <em>interactive statistical
  modeling</em> tools, dynamic filtering methods to eliminate bad and anomalous
  data, and <em>full decision-making power for the appraiser.</em>  A properly
  trained appraiser can produce results that are shockingly good in about 5 minutes
  or so.  Literally, no other solution on the market comes close to matching the
  <em>accuracy, speed, flexibility, and reporting</em> capabilities that PAIRS
  provides at a fraction of the cost.

  <h2>Flexible Workflow</h2>

  <p>
  PAIRS provides a flexible workflow process that provides structure to the
  analysis process, but also allows the appraiser to quickly jump to any portion of
  the analysis process to view or apply changes.  The primary workflow mechanism
  also serves as a progress indicator for the analysis, as shown in the first
  screenshot.
  </p>

  <p>Each page contains <em>Previous:</em> and <em>Next:</em> links for moving
  relatively through the workflow, as well as being able to hop out of the workflow
  using the <em>breadcrumbs</em> links (see: <em>You are here:</em> on any page).
  </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Full Market Analysis</h2>

  <p>
  Appraisers historically use a very small number of <em>comparable sales</em>
  (known as <em>comparables</em> or <em>comps</em>), used to demonstrate (or
  sometimes justify) the assessment of value for a <em>subject property,</em> the
  real property being appraised.  This approach to selecting comps, often using only
  3 to 5 samples, leads to a well-understood quality degradation known as
  <em>selection bias,</em> sometimes referred to as <em>cherry-picking data</em> to
  get the pre-conceived results.
  </p>

  <p>
  GandySoft PAIRS <em>eliminates selection bias</em> by using methods that work well
  with the larger sets of data that encompass the <em>entire market</em> of
  comparable sales.  Appraisers can choose to upload all sales records and current
  listings from their MLS, typically in CSV format.  PAIRS will automatically
  recognize the fields from the CSV, normalize the data values, convert disparate
  fields into discrete <em>property features,</em> and eliminate unnecessary or
  unused fields from the analysis.
  </p>

  <p>

    <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/data-3-fields.png">
    <figcaption>Fields manager</figcaption>
  </div>
  </p>

  <p>
  This provides a broader set of "normal" sales for the market, which greatly
  <em>improves statistical reliability</em>, but also introduces the possibility of
  anomalous and/or bad MLS data that must be dealt with.  MLS data is notoriously
  unreliable, and the relatively low quality of the data poses a major challenge to
  any form of analysis.  PAIRS provides a variety of <em>dynamic filtering</em>
  mechanisms, which gives the appraiser the ability to remove (filter out) data
  that's unreliable, wrong, or truly not comparable with the subject property.
  </p>

  <h2>Subject Details</h2>

  <div class="columns-2-3">
  <p>
  As the <em>appraiser chooses</em> dynamic filters and fields, PAIRS will calculate
  key information automatically, including the <em>Annualized Market Rate,</em> the
  prior <em>12-month Market Rate,</em> and statistical results for all selected
  property features.  The appraiser can <em>override automatic calculations</em> at
  will, giving complete control over the final analysis; all overrides are accounted
  in the final reports.
  </p>

  <p>
  The <em>Subject Details</em> page shows of the <em>distributions and value
  trends</em> for the selected property features, <em>choose the property
  features</em> to include in the analysis, as well as the ability to <em>apply
  range filters</em> for some property features.  As changes are made, the
  <em>graphs automatically update</em> to reflect the current distributions and
  trends, providing <em>immediate feedback</em> to make decisions quickly and
  easily.
  </p>

  <p>
  PAIRS allows the appraiser to <em>select any number of property features</em> to
  analyze for the market, giving the ability to <em>test and account</em> for any
  property feature's <em>contribution to market value.</em>  Common property
  features that contribute to value would be an extra bedroom, an additional garage
  bay, or a pool; however the ability to analyze the contribution of exceptional,
  <em>high-impact property features</em> such as an <em>ocean or lake view, golf
  course frontage, or condo floor level</em> give PAIRS a level of analytic control
  that's truly leading-edge.

  <h2>Market Analysis and Market Conditions</h2>

  <p>
  Part of producing an appraisal includes analyzing overall trends in the market.
  PAIRS provides over <em>40 market charts,</em> capturing <em>trends over time</em>
  for each type of chart.  These charts and the calculated values will be used to
  establish the overall market conditions that will <em>influence the adjustment
  calculations</em> in subsequent workflow steps.
  </p>

    <figcaption>Line and scatter charts</figcaption>
  </div>
  </p>

  <p>
  Market charts can be configured to display in a variety of ways, including choice
  of <em>any of 11 chart statistics,</em> the <em>chart view</em> (8 views
  available), the <em>data rollup</em> to use, the <em>preferred trendline
  calculation,</em> and preference to display trendlines on the chart, as well as a
  number of other chart configuration options.  Charts are <em>automatically
  recalculated</em> as options are changed, allowing <em>rapid experimentation</em>
  to be used to aid decision-making.  Any number of charts may be added, even
  duplicate chart types with different choices for the statistic, view, and rollup.
  </p>

  <p>

  </div>
  </p>

  <p>
  The <em>Market Conditions</em> is an optional form-based chart that's designed to
  emulate the <em>Fannie Mae Form 1004MC.</em>  The form is a text-based summary of
  much of the information provided in graphical form on the other charts.  All
  information contained in the <em>1004MC is automatically calculated</em> based on
  the current data filters and the user's preferences.
  </p>

  <p>
  Various fields on the form 1004MC are designated for specific remarks; PAIRS will
  <em>automatically draft remarks</em> using pre-defined <em>remarks templates.</em>
  A complete set of default <em>remarks templates</em> are provided with PAIRS, and
  the appraiser can customize and override the remarks templates in their <em>user
  profile.</em>  If a custom remarks template exists in the user's profile, it will
  be used; otherwise, the default remarks template will be used.  The appraiser may
  also edit the remarks directly in the 1004MC to reflect actual conditions present
  in the data, but not addressed in the remarks template.  Editing the remarks will
  automatically render the template with actual values once the text caret leaves
  the remarks field.
  </p>

    <figcaption>1004MC select condo project</figcaption>
  </div>
  </p>

  <p>
  Once the changes to the market charts are complete, all calculations and remarks
  are saved.  The 1004MC will be added to the <em>Market Charts Report</em>, if
  chosen, and the market calculations and remarks may be copied directly to the
  actual Form 1004MC, if required for the appraisal.
  </p>

  <h2>Adjustment Analysis</h2>

  <p>
  PAIRS provides two forms of adjustment analysis, both of which leverage the
  <em>appraiser's professional experience</em> to direct the analysis and choose
  credible estimates.  The either or both of the forms may be used for the final
  analysis, and estimates chosen can be <em>reconciled on the Define
  Adjustments</em> page.
  </p>

  <p>
  <em>Basic Statistics</em> is the first, and arguably easiest, form of adjustment
  analytics.  This incorporates up to <em>8 traditional adjustment analysis
  methods</em> and 6 variations to produce adjustment estimates, all of which are
  used to <em>find as many potential estimates as possible</em> for each property
  feature.  Non-conforming values for the property feature are eliminated, and all
  remaining estimates are displayed on a <em>price line.</em>  The appraiser is
  then able to simply <em>move the sliders</em> to choose reasonable value
  estimates for each property feature.  Including more estimates is often better,
  to a point, when the estimates are similar enough to support each other; however,
  for the best results, only adjustment estimates that are <em>credible in the
  appraiser's professional opinion</em> should be included.
  </p>

    <figcaption>Year Built - after selection</figcaption>
  </div>
  </p>

  <p>
  <em>Advanced Modeling</em> is the second form of adjustment analytics, and this
  provides a <em>fully interactive modeling</em> tool based on the proprietary
  <em>iterative matched pairs method.</em>  Multiple options are included to allow
  the appriaser to <em>tune the model</em> to produce the most credible adjustment
  estimates.
  </p>

  <p>

    <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/advanced-modeling-4-no-solution.png">
    <figcaption>Incomplete model</figcaption>
  </div>
  </p>

  <p>
  <em>Extended filtering and market adjustments</em> are made available from within
  the <em>Advanced Modeling</em> page to provide the finest level of control to the
  appraiser that prefers to harness the additional power of <em>statistical
  modeling.</em>  Changes to values and settings on each dialog will be applied automatically once saved.
  </p>

  <p>
  <div class="columns-2">
    <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/advanced-modeling-5-sub-market-filter.png">

    <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/advanced-modeling-6-market-adjustment-dialog.png">
    <figcaption>Market adjustment</figcaption>
  </div>
  </p>

  <p>
  In both forms of adjustment analysis, estimates must be chosen that are
  <em>reasonable in the appraiser's professional opinion;</em> the software
  <em>leaves value judgements to the appriaser's experience.</em>  Property
  features may be added or removed to choose the <em>relevant set of property
  features</em> for the market and subject property, also based on the
  <em>appraiser's experience in the market and professional opinion.</em>  Once
  suitable estimates have been chosen for all selected property features, these may
  be saved to the analysis.
  </p>

  <h2>Reconciliation and Reporting</h2>

  <p>
  Unique to PAIRS, the appraiser has the ability to <em>reconcile</em> estimated
  values found during the analysis process, based on the individual appraiser's
  reconciliation policy.  This occurs on the <em>Define Adjustments</em> page, and
  must be completed before advancing to the reporting pages.
  </p>

  </div>
  </p>

  <p>
  The reports provide validations that all criteria have been successfully met, by
  indicating issues in <span style="color: red">red</span>, as well as displaying
  the <em>PAIRS Validation Stamp</em> at the top/right of the report when all steps
  have been completed successfully and adjustment values are consistent; adjustment
  values may only be <em>checked for consistency, not correctness,</em> as only the
  appraiser can make a value judgement on the correctness of an adjustment value.
  Once complete, these reports can be captured and included in the final appraisal
  as attachments supporting the adjustments applied to reach an appraised value.
