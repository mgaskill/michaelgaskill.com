## About Me

I am *passionate* about making software, and with over *20 years experience* leading
and engineering *commercial-grade* software products, I've been fortunate to work on
a broad range of technologies in multiple capacities.  I currently focus on
architecture and development in *C, C++, and Ruby on Rails,* and am comfortable
working with other languages and technology stacks, when needed.

I stongly prefer *multi-platform development,* and typically cross-develop for
*Windows, Mac OS X, and Unix/Linux* systems.  I fundamentally believe that *good
software* should be designed independently of the operating system and natively
built to make best use of each O/S.  More than just portable look-and-feel user
interfaces or least-common-denominator software, I develop fully-functional support
for each platform using the most *native and natural form* for the platform.

I'm skilled in using a wide range of technologies and concerns, including *SQL and
noSQL databases, APIs and libraries, graphics processing, communications and
protocols, compression, encryption, multi-threading, and design and optimization for
performance and scalability.*

Automated testing, particularly *unit testing,* is a standard part of my development
process.  Good software built on verified components is far more reliable and
produces the *high quality* necessary for commercial products.  Whether testing
occurs before, during, or after development is subjective; the important thing is
that thorough automated testing is performed at the code level.

I think and act like an *entrepreneur,* and I'm typically seen as a *go-getter* and
a *highly creative* type.  I tend to *take ownership* of my products, and make
myself both *responsible and accountable* for their success.
