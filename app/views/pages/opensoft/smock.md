## Smock

<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
I designed and developed the full-stack customer-facing application to allow customers
to design or customize their own print materials in the browser and save them to their
account for future print work. If the customer chose to start with a PDF or [Adobe
Illustrator][1] file, the file would be imported into the [Da Vinci Service][2] visual
designer, allowing the customer to make changes or accept the design for print work.
Customers were also provided hundreds of pre-designed templates to choose from, if they
didn't have a design to start from.

The customer could place an order for a completed design through the separate eCommerce
app at [OvernightPrints.com][3], and Smock would submit the design to the internal print
workflow system. Smock validated that the design was fully printable with the existing
print devices (each had unique capabilities) and submit the print request into the
lowest cost workflow that could accommodate the design.
