## [Kiavi][1] (formerly LendingHome)

Kiavi is the largest Fix & Flip lender in the U.S., with additional products for Rental and Rental Portfolio products. The company has written over [50,000 loans totalling more than $12B][2] as of late 2022. Kiavi is a Series E VC-funded startup that has raised $400M from investors such as Foundation Capital, Ribbit Capital, and First Round Capital.

I held multiple roles at Kiavi, starting as a Staff Software Engineer, and moving into management after a year. I held roles as Engineering Director and as VP of Engineering while in management, but eventually moved to be the companyâ€™s only Principal Software Engineer. For 2 years while in the VP of Engineering role, I was also Head of Data Infrastructure, which managed our data pipelines and data warehouse.
