## Property Appraisals

I was originally hired into the company to build a sophisticated real estate appraisal
solution, as this was considered the primary business pain point for mortgage
processing. I developed integrations with multiple industry vendors, developed the
Stripe payments system for pre-paying for appraisals, and developed a sophisticated
workflow for managing the appraisal process.

As a domain expert in the real estate appraisal space, I also produced training
materials for engineers and non-engineers to be able to understand the process, the
terms, and the subtlety of the process and how it applies to real estate transactions.
