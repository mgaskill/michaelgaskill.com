## Automated Borrower Underwriting

I volunteered to lead a project to make the acquisition of novice real estate investor
borrowers profitable for the company. Novice borrowers represented a significantly
greater risk of failure at the time, consumed vast amounts of operations resources, and
were expensive to aquire in the first place. Ultimately, this resulted in very low
margins or losses on most loans to novice borrowers. The company was looking to
determine whether they should embrace or reject the novice borrower opportunities.
Working with a cross-functional team that included Marketing, Risk, and Product, we came
up with a solution that would allow us to automatically underwrite the best of the
novice borrowers with no operational overhead, whatsoever.

### Performance During the Pandemic

This project took 3 months to design and implement, and resulted in novice borrowers
growing from 6% of total revenue to 24% within the first year. During the height of the
pandemic, novice borrowers became 56% of all revenue, and kept the company afloat when
most other competitors went out of business or paused operations. Because of this
project, Kiavi went from having a 2.5% marketshare immediately before the pandemic to an
8% marketshare by Sept 2020; the next closest competitor had 1.1% marketshare.

### Business Driver for New Architecture

Due to the exceptional performance that we observed from the automated borrower
underwrite for novice borrowers, the company moved forward with plans to provide similar
features for professional borrowers and for underwriting properties for all loans. This
was one of the driving business forces behind moving to the
[new architecture][1].
