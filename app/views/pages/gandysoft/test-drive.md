## PAIRS Test Drive

Following these simple steps, you can see how PAIRS works, and what's involved in
completing an appraisal analysis. This process demonstrates _Basic Statistics_ as
the method to produce appraisal adjustments, as the _Advanced Modeling_ method
requires significantly more effort and understanding of multiple concepts to
demonstrate fully.

For video examples of all methods contained in this test drive, as well as complete
coverage of the _Advanced Modeling_ method, please see the [GandySoft YouTube
Channel][2].

</div>

### Step 2: Create the Analysis

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
From the [main page][1], click the *Create a New PAIRS Analysis* link
(bottom/right of *screenshot #3* above).

Fill in the details of the analysis, as shown in _screenshot #4_ on the right.
Set the _Title_ field to _Test Drive_, leave the _Property Type_ field set to
_Single Family,_ choose _2017-01-18_ for the _Effective Date_, leave the _License_
field blank, and click the _Save_ button.

Note that choosing a different date for the _Effective Date_ will cause minor
differences in the analysis results, as this date is used to calculate time-based
adjustments that are applied throughout the analysis.

</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-04-create-analysis.png">
  <figcaption>4: Create an Analysis</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
Once the analysis is created, the _Analysis Overview_ will be shown, as seen in
_screenshot #5_ to the right. The <span style="color: forestgreen">green
checkmark</span> indicates that the step has been completed, and the <span
style="color: #215f8b">blue buttons</span> show which steps are available in the
workflow, based on current progress. The first analysis step (_Details_) has
aleady been completed simply by creating the analysis and filling in the details
above, enabling progress to continue to the _Data_ step.

You can easily return to the _Analysis Overview_ page at any time by clicking the
title link of the analysis (in this case, _Test Drive_) in the _You Are Here:_
breadcrumbs at the top of any page of the analysis.

  <figcaption>5: Analysis Overview</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

### Step 3: Upload the Analysis Data

Download the sample data file [gandysoft-sample-data.csv][3] used for this test
drive. If prompted by your browser, save this data file in a location that you can
easily find again.

Click the _Change_ button on the _Data_ step of the _Analysis Overview_ to progress
to the _Data_ step. Once there, click the _Source_ dropdown to select the _MLS
data source_ for this analysis (see _screenshot #6_ below). Choose _Greater Las
Vegas Association of Realtors._ Note that the _How to Upload_ instructions and the
_MLS data field mappings_ change when the _Source_ is changed, so it's important to
select the _Greater Las Vegas Association of Realtors_ option.

Click the _Upload_ button, and choose the sample data file
[gandysoft-sample-data.csv][3] downloaded at the beginning of this step. The page
will briefly go to a _Loading..._ state as the data is uploaded and processed.
Once _Loading..._ is complete, a data browser (see _screenshot #7_ below) will be
shown, allowing perusal of the processed data.

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-06-choose-data-source.png">
  <figcaption>6: Select the Data Source</figcaption>
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-2">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-07-upload.png">
  <figcaption>7: Data Browser</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

Note that the data displayed in the data browser will not be an exact match for the
fields from the CSV file, as the source data goes through more than _600 data
normalization processes_ and _field mappings_ to achieve the result that's
displayed.

Click the _Next: Subject Details_ link at the top/right of the page, below the
banner, to progress to the next step in the analysis.

For additional information, see:

- the [Analysis Data][4] overview

### Step 4: Subject Details

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
Once you've reached the Subject Details page, you'll see a screen that resembles
_screenshot #8_ below. This page is provides a _visual review_ of the key _property
features_ (also known as _variables_) of the analysis. From this point, variables
may be added or removed from the analysis, and _range filters_ may be applied, as
necessary.
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-08-subject-details.png">
  <figcaption>8: Subject Details</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
Click on either chart next to one of the variables to see a larger popup view of
that variable's data distribution. The column chart provides a distribution of the
discrete values of the variable, while the scatter chart shows the distribution of
the variable's values by sales price. _Screenshot #9_ shows the scatter plot popup
for the _Lot Size_ variable, which upon closer inspection shows that at least some
of the _Lot Size_ values may actually be outliers in the data.

</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-09-subject-details-lot-size-popup.png">
  <figcaption>9: Lot Size Popup Chart</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

To remove the outlier values, enter _8000_ on the _Value_ field under the _Lot Size_
variable and _40_ in the _Range_ field directly below that, then press the _Tab_
key to leave the field. The Lot Size chart will update instantly to reflect the
new filter, as can be seen in _screenshot #10_. Additionally, the _quick
filters_ at the top of the page indicate that there are now _46 Sub-Market_
records, of a possible _51 Valid_ records, showing that the _Lot Size_ filter was
effective.

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
Note that the _Garage Bays_ variable now has a _potential data issue,_ having only a
_singlular sale with 2 Garage Bays_ after filtering _Lot Size,_ as can be seen in
the _screenshot #11_ below. A knowlegable appraiser may choose to remove the
variable at this point; however, as the variables analyzed on this page are
_independent of one another_ and _without market rate adjustments,_ we'll opt to
leave that variable to be handled at a later step.
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-11-subject-details-garage-bays-popup.png">
  <figcaption>11: Garage Bays Popup Chart</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

After filtering and choosing variables, click the _Save_ button at the bottom of
the page to save the changes to the analysis. Once saved, click the _Next: Market
Analysis_ link at the top / right of the page.

For additional information, see:

- the [Subject Details][5] overview

### Step 5: Market Analysis Charts

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
The Market Analysis / Charts page presents a wide variety of charts that can be
configured to display and tune market-oriented information presentation.
_Screenshot #12_ shows the first two charts that appear by default: the _Sales and
Active Listings_ chart and the _Sales and List Price_ chart, additional charts
appear below those on-screen that are not shown in this image. In the screenshot,
the charts have been customized beyond the default views; click on each chart to
show the _View_ and _Chart data_ options.

</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-12-market-charts.png">
  <figcaption>12: Market Charts</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
The Form 1004MC chart, as seen in _screenshot #13_, provides summary market
analysis statistics and remarks. Certain market assessment information cannot and
should not be automatically calculated, and must be completed by the appraiser;
these include the radio button selections for assessment of market trends and
extraneous market factors.
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-13-1004mc.png">
  <figcaption>13: 1004MC</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
Click on any _remarks_ field on the Form 1004MC chart to see or edit the underlying
template, as shown in _screenshot #14,_ above. The Form 1004MC remarks fields are
automatically completed from pre-defined _remarks templates,_ rendered with the
current market rate and calculated market values. The changes to the remarks
template are saved with the analysis.
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-14-1004mc-editing.png">
  <figcaption>14: Editing 1004MC Remarks</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

Click the _Save_ button at the bottom of the page to save any changes made on this
page. Once saved, click the _Next: Basic Statistics_ link at the top / right of
the page to proceed to the next step in the workflow.

For additional information, see:

- the [Market Charts][6] overview

### Step 6: Basic Statistics

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
The primary purpose of _Basic Statistics_ is to select the _credible estimates_ for
each variable from the set of estimates calculated by the various methods. These
estimates are charted along a _price line_, with sliders that are used to identify
the high and low bounds of the estimate range. _Screenshot #15_ shows the initial
view of the _Bathrooms_ variable.
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-15-basic-statistics-bathrooms.png">
  <figcaption>15: Bathrooms Initial</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
Choose the left slider in the center of the chart, and then move it to include the
_$1,995.22 Fitted Squares by Val (Mean)_ estimate. Choose the right slider and move
it to include the _$8,676.85 Leveled Grouping by Val (Megamean)_ estimate.
_Screenshot #16_ shows the expected placement of the range sliders, highlighting
the estimates in the range. These represent the low and high bounds of the
credible range for the value of an additional _Bathroom_ in this market; different
markets may have entirely different values for the same variable.
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-4">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-16-basic-statistics-bathrooms.png">
  <figcaption>16: Bathrooms Selection</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
Earlier, we deferred handling the potential issue with the _Garage Bays_ variable,
and this is time to address it. _Screenshot #17_ shows the estimates for an
additional _Garage Bay_, and the estimates given are clearly unreliable, due to
relatively poor data representation. Occasionally, this will also occur when the
variable has no true market impact on the sale price, or has a dependency with
another variable. There are four potential solutions to addressing the _Garage
Bays_ variable in this example:
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-17-basic-statistics-garage-bays.png">
  <figcaption>17: Garage Bays Initial</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

- select the _only credible estimate,_ limiting the ability to reconcile this
  specific variable
- remove the variable from the analysis
- use _Advanced Modeling_ to tune the analysis and model the value
- filter out the singlular record with _2 Garage Bays_

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
Any of these options may reasonably be chosen, and a skilled appraiser will have
good justification on which choice was made. In this case, we'll choose the first
option, and select the single estimate; the estimated value is actually
reasonable for a _Garage Bay_ in this market. Move the sliders to highlight the
estimate as shown in screenshot #18,\*.
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-18-basic-statistics-garage-bays.png">
  <figcaption>18: Garage Bays Selection</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

Once these choices have been made, click the _Save_ button at the bottom of the
page. After _Save_, click the _Next: Define Adjustments_ link at the top / right
of the page; _do not_ click the _Advanced Modeling_ link, as this may needlessly
complicate the analysis.

Additional information can be found in:

- the [Adjustment Analysis][7] overview
- the [Basic Statistics][8] overview

### Step 7: Reconciliation and Reporting

_Reconciliation_ is the process used by appraisers to take estimates for a variable
and define a specific adjustment value that will be used in the appraisal. Often,
this simply involves rounding the value or averaging multiple values to a single
value. PAIRS Reconciliation process does most of this for the appraiser, and
provides the ability to override the calculated reconciliation values.

_Screenshot #19_ shows the inital Reconciliation page, with automatically
calculated estimates provided in the _Adjustment_ field. Click and change the
_Bathrooms_ field to _4000_ and then click the _Save_ button. The value of _4000_
is within the range of _credible estimates_ for an additional _Bathroom_, and so is
a completely credible adjustment value, supported by the 8 methods highlighted in
_Screenshot #16,_ above.

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-1-2">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-19-define-adjustments.png">
  <figcaption>19: Estimated Adjustments</figcaption>

<div class="pure-u-1-2">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-20-define-adjustments.png">
  <figcaption>20: Reconciled Adjustments</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

Click the _Save_ button to save the changes, and then click the _Next: Validate Adjustments_ link to proceed to the \*Adjustments Report.

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
The _Adjustments Report_ shows the variables chosen, the adjustment for each
variable, and the estimation methods supporting each adjustment. _Screenshot #21_
shows the top portion of this report for this analysis. This report is typically
captured as a PDF and attached to the final appraisal report.
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-3">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-21-validate-adjustments.png">
  <figcaption>21: Adjustments Report</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
Click the _Next: View Workfile Report_ link at the top / right of the page to
proceed to the _Workfile Report._ The _Workfile Report,_ shown in _Screenshot #22_
includes many additional details for each adjustment, including each of the
estimate values, the range used, and information about the variable's values. This
report is also typically captured as a PDF file and kept in the appraisal workfile,
the permanent record of the appraiser's activity while creating the appraisal.
</div>

<div class="pure-u-1-4">
  <img class="screenshot" src="/images/gandysoft/test-drive-22-workfile-report.png">
  <figcaption>22: Workfile Report</figcaption>
</div>
</div>

Click the _Next: View Market Report_ link to proceed to the _Market Report._ This
report collects the details collected in the _Market Analysis_ portion of the
workflow. This may also be captured as a PDF file or as separate images, and
attached to the appraisal, supporting the Form 1004MC and adjustment estimates.

Click the _Next: View 1004MC Report_ link to proceed to the _1004MC Report._ This
displays the same information provided on the _Form 1004MC_ chart on the _Market
Analysis_ page, although it is no longer editable. Content from this page is
typically copied to the actual Form 1004MC contained in the appraisal.

Finally, click the _Next: View Analysis_ link to proceed to the _Analysis Overview._
This overview should be relatively complete, with checkmarks indicating progress
through all items, except _Advanced Modeling,_ which was intentionally skipped.

At this point, the analysis is complete. Congratulations!
