## Reporting

Reporting provides validation that all criteria have been successfully met, by
using visual indications of issues in <span style="color: red">red</span>.  Once all
steps have been completed successfully and adjustment values are consistent, the
*PAIRS Validation Stamp* will be displayed at the top/right of the report.  Note
that adjustments may only be *checked for consistency, not correctness,* as only the
appraiser can make a value judgement for an adjustment.

Once complete, these reports can be captured as individual images or a single PDF,
and included in the final appraisal as attachments supporting the adjustments
applied to reach an appraised value.
