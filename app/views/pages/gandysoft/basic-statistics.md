## Basic Statistics

This is the first, and arguably easiest, form of adjustment analytics, incorporating
up to _8 traditional adjustment analysis methods_ and multiple variations to produce
adjustment estimates. All of these are used to _find as many potential estimates as
possible_ for each property feature. Non-conforming values for the property feature
are eliminated, and all remaining estimates are displayed on a _price line._ The
appraiser is then able to simply _move the sliders_ to choose reasonable value
estimates for each property feature.

Including more estimates is often better, when the estimates are similar enough to
support each other; however, for the best results, only adjustment estimates that
are _credible in the appraiser's professional opinion_ should be included. In fact,
using multiple credible estimates to support the adjustment estimate will greatly
improve the strength of the analysis.
