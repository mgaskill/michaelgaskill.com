## Basic Statistics

This is the first, and arguably easiest, form of adjustment analytics, incorporating
up to *8 traditional adjustment analysis methods* and multiple variations to produce
adjustment estimates.  All of these are used to *find as many potential estimates as
possible* for each property feature.  Non-conforming values for the property feature
are eliminated, and all remaining estimates are displayed on a *price line.*  The
appraiser is then able to simply *move the sliders* to choose reasonable value
estimates for each property feature.

Including more estimates is often better, when the estimates are similar enough to
support each other; however, for the best results, only adjustment estimates that
are *credible in the appraiser's professional opinion* should be included.  In fact,
using multiple credible estimates to support the adjustment estimate will greatly
improve the strength of the analysis.
