## Flexible Workflow

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
PAIRS provides a flexible workflow process that provides *structure to the analysis*
process, but also allows the appraiser to quickly jump to any portion of the
analysis process to view or apply changes.

The primary workflow mechanism serves as a _progress indicator_ for the analysis, as
shown in the screenshot. A <span style="color: forestgreen">green checkmark</span>
on the left side of the page indicates that the workflow step has been completed;
the first step, _Details_ is automatically completed when the analysis is created.
The <span style="color: #215f8b">blue buttons</span> at the right of the page show
which workflow steps are accessible, given the steps that have been completed.

Each page contains _Previous:_ and _Next:_ links at the top left and top right of
the page, used to proceed to the linked next or previous page in the workflow. Using
wizard-style naviation, these provide relative progression through the workflow.
Additionally, the user can ascend to the _Workflow Overview_ using the _breadcrumbs_
link (see the _You are here:_ elements) at the top of any page of the analysis.
