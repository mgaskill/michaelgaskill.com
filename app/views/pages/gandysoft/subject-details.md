## Subject Details

As the _appraiser chooses_ dynamic filters and fields, PAIRS will calculate key
information automatically, including the _Annualized Market Rate,_ the prior
_12-month Market Rate,_ and statistical results for all selected property features,
also known as variables. The appraiser can _override automatic calculations_ at
will, giving complete control over the final analysis; all overrides are accounted
in the final reports.

The _Subject Details_ page displays _distributions and value trends_ for the
selected variables, allows _selection of the variables_ to include in the analysis,
and the ability to _apply range filters_ for some variables. As changes are made,
the _graphs automatically update_ to reflect the current distributions and trends,
providing _immediate feedback_ to make decisions quickly and easily.

At the top of the page are _4 quick filter_ selections for _All Records, Sales,
Valid, and Sub-Market,_ affecting only the view on this page. The number of
matching records is shown alongside each selection. The _All Records_ filter
selection displays the charts with _no filters_ applied. The _Sales_ filter shows
only those records that are sales, thereby _eliminating listings, canceled, or
withdrawn_ records from the chart display. The _Valid_ filter removes any sales
records with critical data errors, such as _missing Livable Area or Lot Size_
values. The _Sub-Market_ filter applies the _Valid_ filter and _Sales_ filter, and
additionally applies the custom filters specified for any variables; _Sub-Market_ is
appraisal terminology for the entire market of _comparable_ sales for the _Subject
Property._

Custom filters may be applied for some variables on this page by filling the _Value_
and _Range_ fields next to the variables. The _Value_ field is used to indicate the
actual value from the _Subject Property,_ while the _Range_ field is used to specify
the range of values to be filtered out, relative to the _Value_ field. For example,
if the _Value_ is _8,000_, and the _Range_ is _20%_, the filter will include
properties that have _values from 6,400 to 9,600._ When specifying a custom filter
for a variable, the charts will automatically update to reflect the new filters.

Clicking on either chart to the right of a variable will display a larger popup view
of that data distribution. The column chart provides a histogram of the discrete
values of the variable, and the view in the popup can be changed to display any of 8
chart types. The scatter chart shows the distribution of the variable's values by
sales price.

Variables may be added to the analysis by selecting the variable in the dropdown
list at the bottom of the page and clicking the _Add_ button. Variables can be
removed from the analysis by clicking the <span style="color: indianred">red X</span>
at the left of a variable's title.

Clicking the _Save_ button at the bottom of the page will save the changes made to
the filters and the set of variables selected.
