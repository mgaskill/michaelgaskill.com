## Subject Details

As the *appraiser chooses* dynamic filters and fields, PAIRS will calculate key
information automatically, including the *Annualized Market Rate,* the prior
*12-month Market Rate,* and statistical results for all selected property features,
also known as variables.  The appraiser can *override automatic calculations* at
will, giving complete control over the final analysis; all overrides are accounted
in the final reports.

The *Subject Details* page displays *distributions and value trends* for the
selected variables, allows *selection of the variables* to include in the analysis,
and the ability to *apply range filters* for some variables.  As changes are made,
the *graphs automatically update* to reflect the current distributions and trends,
providing *immediate feedback* to make decisions quickly and easily.

At the top of the page are *4 quick filter* selections for *All Records, Sales,
Valid, and Sub-Market,* affecting only the view on this page.  The number of
matching records is shown alongside each selection.  The *All Records* filter
selection displays the charts with *no filters* applied.  The *Sales* filter shows
only those records that are sales, thereby *eliminating listings, canceled, or
withdrawn* records from the chart display.  The *Valid* filter removes any sales
records with critical data errors, such as *missing Livable Area or Lot Size*
values.  The *Sub-Market* filter applies the *Valid* filter and *Sales* filter, and
additionally applies the custom filters specified for any variables; *Sub-Market* is
appraisal terminology for the entire market of *comparable* sales for the *Subject
Property.*

Custom filters may be applied for some variables on this page by filling the *Value*
and *Range* fields next to the variables.  The *Value* field is used to indicate the
actual value from the *Subject Property,* while the *Range* field is used to specify
the range of values to be filtered out, relative to the *Value* field.  For example,
if the *Value* is *8,000*, and the *Range* is *20%*, the filter will include
properties that have *values from 6,400 to 9,600.*  When specifying a custom filter
for a variable, the charts will automatically update to reflect the new filters.

Clicking on either chart to the right of a variable will display a larger popup view
of that data distribution.  The column chart provides a histogram of the discrete
values of the variable, and the view in the popup can be changed to display any of 8
chart types.  The scatter chart shows the distribution of the variable's values by
sales price.

Variables may be added to the analysis by selecting the variable in the dropdown
list at the bottom of the page and clicking the *Add* button.  Variables can be
removed from the analysis by clicking the <span style="color: indianred">red X</span>
at the left of a variable's title.

Clicking the *Save* button at the bottom of the page will save the changes made to
the filters and the set of variables selected.
