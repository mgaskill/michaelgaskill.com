## Market Analysis and Charting

Part of producing an appraisal includes analyzing overall trends in the market.
PAIRS provides over _40 market charts,_ capturing _trends over time_ for each type
of chart. These charts and the calculated values will be used to establish the
overall market conditions that will _influence the adjustment calculations_ in
subsequent workflow steps.

At the top of the page, just below the _quick filters,_ you can see three options
for the _Market Rate._ The option to _Auto Calculate Market Rates_ will do
precisely that, based on the market data and the current filters. Second, the
_Market Rate_ field either displays the _calculated market rate_ or allows the
appraiser to enter the market rate, depending on whether the _Auto Calculate Market
Rates_ checkbox is checked. The _Unadjusted Days_ setting defines the number of
days for which _market rate adjustments should not be made._

Market charts can be configured to display in a variety of ways, including choice of
_any of 11 chart statistics,_ the _chart view_ (8 views available), the _data rollup_
to use, the _preferred trendline calculation,_ and preference to display trendlines
on the chart, as well as a number of other chart options. Charts are _automatically
recalculated_ as options are changed, allowing _rapid experimentation_ to be used to
aid decision-making.

Any number of charts may be shown. Charts may be added via the _Add_ button at the
bottom of the page, or removed by clicking the <span style="color: brickred">red
X</span> next to the chart title. Any number of charts may be added, even duplicate
chart types with different choices for the statistic, view, and rollup options.

Any charts present on this page will appear on the _Market Analysis Report_, by
default; de-select the _Show in Report_ option to remove any chart from the report.

Charts may be re-ordered using the arrow options at the right of the title bar. The
chart order shown on this page is the order in which the charts will appear on the
final _Market Analysis Report._

Clicking the _Save_ button at the bottom of the page will save all changes made to
the charts. When the _Save as Default_ option is checked, the chart configurations,
as they appear in the analysis, will be saved and become the default formats for
subsequent analyses. Note that any edits made to the _remarks templates_ in the
analysis will only be saved to the current, as any changes made are likely to be
specific to the analysis; to make long-term changes to the _remarks templates_, the
_User Profile Preferences_ provides _remarks templates_ configuration options.
