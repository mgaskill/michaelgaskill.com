## Market Analysis and Charting

Part of producing an appraisal includes analyzing overall trends in the market.
PAIRS provides over *40 market charts,* capturing *trends over time* for each type
of chart.  These charts and the calculated values will be used to establish the
overall market conditions that will *influence the adjustment calculations* in
subsequent workflow steps.

At the top of the page, just below the *quick filters,* you can see three options
for the *Market Rate.*  The option to *Auto Calculate Market Rates* will do
precisely that, based on the market data and the current filters.  Second, the
*Market Rate* field either displays the *calculated market rate* or allows the
appraiser to enter the market rate, depending on whether the *Auto Calculate Market
Rates* checkbox is checked.  The *Unadjusted Days* setting defines the number of
days for which *market rate adjustments should not be made.*

Market charts can be configured to display in a variety of ways, including choice of
*any of 11 chart statistics,* the *chart view* (8 views available), the *data rollup*
to use, the *preferred trendline calculation,* and preference to display trendlines
on the chart, as well as a number of other chart options.  Charts are *automatically
recalculated* as options are changed, allowing *rapid experimentation* to be used to
aid decision-making.

Any number of charts may be shown.  Charts may be added via the *Add* button at the
bottom of the page, or removed by clicking the <span style="color: brickred">red
X</span> next to the chart title.  Any number of charts may be added, even duplicate
chart types with different choices for the statistic, view, and rollup options.

Any charts present on this page will appear on the *Market Analysis Report*, by
default; de-select the *Show in Report* option to remove any chart from the report.

Charts may be re-ordered using the arrow options at the right of the title bar.  The
chart order shown on this page is the order in which the charts will appear on the
final *Market Analysis Report.*

Clicking the *Save* button at the bottom of the page will save all changes made to
the charts.  When the *Save as Default* option is checked, the chart configurations,
as they appear in the analysis, will be saved and become the default formats for
subsequent analyses.  Note that any edits made to the *remarks templates* in the
analysis will only be saved to the current, as any changes made are likely to be
specific to the analysis; to make long-term changes to the *remarks templates*, the
*User Profile Preferences* provides *remarks templates* configuration options.
