## Subject Details

As the *appraiser chooses* dynamic filters and fields, PAIRS will calculate key
information automatically, including the *Annualized Market Rate,* the prior
*12-month Market Rate,* and statistical results for all selected property features.
The appraiser can *override automatic calculations* at will, giving complete control
over the final analysis; all overrides are accounted in the final reports.

The *Subject Details* page shows the *distributions and value trends* for the
selected property features, *choose the property features* to include in the
analysis, as well as the ability to *apply range filters* for some property
features.  As changes are made, the *graphs automatically update* to reflect the
current distributions and trends, providing *immediate feedback* to make decisions
quickly and easily.

PAIRS allows the appraiser to *select any number of property features* to analyze
for the market, giving the ability to *test and account* for any property feature's
*contribution to market value.*  Common property features that contribute to value
would be an extra bedroom, an additional garage bay, or a pool; however the ability
to analyze the contribution of exceptional, *high-impact property features* such as
an *ocean or lake view, golf course frontage, or condo floor level* give PAIRS a
level of analytic control that's truly leading-edge.
