## Subject Details

As the *appraiser chooses* dynamic filters and fields, PAIRS will calculate key
information automatically, including the *Annualized Market Rate,* the prior
*12-month Market Rate,* and statistical results for all selected property features.
The appraiser can *override automatic calculations* at will, giving complete control
over the final analysis; all overrides are accounted in the final reports.

The *Subject Details* page shows the *distributions and value trends* for the
selected property features, *choose the property features* to include in the
analysis, as well as the ability to *apply range filters* for some property
features.  As changes are made, the *graphs automatically update* to reflect the
current distributions and trends, providing *immediate feedback* to make decisions
quickly and easily.

PAIRS allows the appraiser to *select any number of property features* to analyze
for the market, giving the ability to *test and account* for any property feature's
*contribution to market value.*  Common property features that contribute to value
would be an extra bedroom, an additional garage bay, or a pool; however the ability
to analyze the value contribution of exceptional, *high-impact property features*
such as an *ocean or lake view, golf course frontage, or condo floor level* give
PAIRS a level of analytic control that's truly leading-edge.

At the top of the page are *4 quick filter* selections for *All Records, Sales,
Valid, and Sub-Market,* affecting only the view on this page.  The number of
matching records is shown alongside each selection.  The *All Records* filter
selection essentially displays the charts with *no filters* applied.  The *Sales*
filter shows only those records that are sales, thereby *eliminating listings,
canceled, or withdrawn* records from the chart display.  The *Valid* filter removes
any sales records with critical data errors, such as *missing Livable Area or Lot
Size* values.  The *Sub-Market* filter applies the *Valid* filter and *Sales*
filter, and additionally applies the custom filters specified for any variables,
such as the filter that we just specified for the *Lot Size* variable; *Sub-Market*
is appraisal terminology for the entire market of *comparable* sales for the
*Subject Property.*

Clicking the *Save* button at the bottom of the page will save the changes made to
the filters and the set of variables selected.
