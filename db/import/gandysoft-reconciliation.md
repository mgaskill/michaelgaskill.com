## Reconciliation

<div class="pure-g">
<div class="pure-u-2-3" markdown="1">
Unique to PAIRS, the appraiser has the ability to *reconcile adjustments* with the
estimates chosen during the analysis process.  The appraiser may apply their
individual preferences for reconciling adjustments, and those reconciled values will
be validated to the chosen estimates.  Reconciliation occurs on the *Define
Adjustments* page, and simply involves choosing a specific adjustment value within
the range for the property feature.  Once all adjustments have been reconciled and
saved, the appraiser can continue on to the *Reporting* pages.
