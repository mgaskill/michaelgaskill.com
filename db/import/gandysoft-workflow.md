PAIRS provides a flexible workflow process that provides structure to the analysis
process, but also allows the appraiser to quickly jump to any portion of the
analysis process to view or apply changes.  The primary workflow mechanism also
serves as a progress indicator for the analysis, as shown in the screenshot.

Each page contains *Previous:* and *Next:* links for moving relatively through the
workflow, as well as being able to hop out of the workflow using the *breadcrumbs*
links (see: *You are here:* on any page).
