## Adjustment Analysis

PAIRS provides two forms of adjustment analysis, both of which leverage the
*appraiser's professional experience* to direct the analysis and choose credible
estimates.  The either or both of the forms may be used for the final analysis, and
estimates chosen can be *reconciled on the Define Adjustments* page.

* [Basic Statistics][1]
* [Advanced Modeling][2]

In both forms of adjustment analysis, estimates must be chosen that are *reasonable
in the appraiser's professional opinion;* the software *leaves value judgements to
the appriaser's experience.*  Property features may be added or removed to choose
the *relevant set of property features* for the market and subject property, also
based on the *appraiser's experience in the market and professional opinion.*  Once
suitable estimates have been chosen for all selected property features, these may be
saved to the analysis.
