## Technical Leadership

I'm a *software architect* at heart, and that's the foundation for my technical
leadership skills.  I practice *frank and open communication,* and believe that a
leader is a *specialized* facet of the team, not a separated role.  I find that this
approach fosters teamwork and mutual respect, which ultimately means greater team
productivity.

I am skilled at working with non-engineering folks, as well, including *executive
management, product management, sales, marketing*.  I'm good working directly with
customers and comfortable interacting with the media.  Within a development team, I
explicitly take the role of *liaison* to non-technical members, so as to provide a
buffer for the team to *mitigate* distractions and interruptions, as well as to
ensure *consistent communication.*
