## Full Market Analysis

Appraisers historically use a very small number of *comparable sales*, known as
*comparables* or *comps*, used to demonstrate (or sometimes justify) the assessment
of value for a *subject property,* the real property being appraised.  This approach
to selecting comps, often using *only 3 to 5 samples,* leads to a well-understood
quality degradation known as *selection bias,* sometimes referred to as
*cherry-picking data* to get the pre-conceived results.

GandySoft PAIRS *eliminates selection bias* by using methods that work well with the
larger sets of data that encompass the *entire market* of comparable sales.
Appraisers can choose to upload all sales records and current listings from their
MLS, typically in CSV format.  PAIRS will automatically recognize the fields from
the CSV, normalize the data values, convert disparate fields into discrete *property
features,* and eliminate unnecessary or unused fields from the analysis.

This provides a broader set of "normal" sales for the market, which greatly
*improves statistical reliability*, but also introduces the possibility of anomalous
and/or bad MLS data that must be dealt with.  MLS data is notoriously unreliable,
and the relatively low quality of the data poses a major challenge to any form of
analysis.  PAIRS provides a variety of *dynamic filtering* mechanisms, which gives
the appraiser the ability to remove (filter out) data that's unreliable, wrong, or
truly not comparable with the subject property.
