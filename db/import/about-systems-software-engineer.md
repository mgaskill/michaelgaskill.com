## Systems Software Engineer

As a systems engineer, I design and write *GUI, console, and service-based products,*
as well as SOA server components.  The languages that I primarily work with for
systems software are *C and C++,* although I also use other languages, such as
*Ruby, Java, C#, Delphi, Objective-C, and Python,* when required.

I typically write GUI applications to the platform's *native APIs* or using an
application framework.  For C++ applications, I use *Qt, wxWidgets, Ultimate++, MFC,*
or a custom framework; alternative to C++, I use Delphi VCL, Java Swing, or Cocoa.
All things being equal, I prefer to use a porting framework as the basis for a
GUI-based product.  The types of GUI applications include *developer utilities,
power user tools, text manipulation, media players, graphics processing, and
database management and reporting systems.*  Sometimes, this means building
something truly unique, such as *custom controls, skinned interfaces, or
non-rectangular windows.*

I have developed *Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)* workflow services, both
within an *Enterprise Service Bus (ESB),* and independantly in a *microservices
architecure* fashion.  I am familiar with using various ESB systems, including
*Oracle Tuxedo, TIBCO, and MicroSoft BizTalk,* as well as message-queue middleware,
such as *IBM MQ, Microsoft MQ, RabbitMQ, and Java JMS.*

I conceived, architected, and co-developed a full SOA product, named BroadSight,
that was developed to implement the *Object Management Group (OMG)* TINA-C
specification for telecommunications interoperability.  BroadSight was a
telecom-grade product, with support for services written in *C, C++, and Java* and
bus service available via *CORBA, COM/DCOM, SOAP, Java RMI, and an efficient
proprietary wire protocol.*  The was used successfully on *Windows, Linux, and
Solaris*, and was designed to be fully platform-independent.
